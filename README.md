#Summary of Application
The main idea behind the application was to create an app that would use Bluetooth meshnetworking to establish a chat room and let people connect and send messages to each other.
##Current Progress of Application
Currently the application allows two devices to connect via Bluetooth and send messages. We have most of the threading classes completed for expanding into multiple devices but we ran out of time before we could implement it.
